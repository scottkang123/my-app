          <p>
          I have earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Vanderbilt University School of Engineering. My major is Computer Science, 
          and my minors are Mathematics, Economics, and Chemistry. I am excited to leverage my academic knowledge and passion for 
          software engineering to contribute in cutting-edge projects. My proficiency in programming coupled with my creative problem-solving skills 
          enable me to write optimized and scalable code that adheres to industry best practices. I also possess a strong foundation in algorithms, 
          data structures, and software design principles, which I believe will be valuable in formulating innovative solutions to meet both product 
          and technology roadmaps. I am excited about the prospect of working in a collaborative Agile environment, engaging with multiple stakeholders 
          to develop end-to-end technology solutions.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have gained proficiency in several programming languages including C++, Python, Java, C#, Matlab, Racket, and Prolog during my coursework 
            at Vanderbilt University. Additionally, during my internship at Stryker, I utilized C# to develop test cases using the Selenium library and 
            created a debugging tool for communicating with various networking devices. For full-stack projects, I have leveraged JavaScript, the React library, 
            the Jest testing framework, and Firebase to construct a Reuse Market website for Vanderbilt University. I have also employed Java, Angular, Spring Boot, 
            Amazon S3, and MongoDB to build a YouTube Clone for my personal project. Additionally, my strong interest in data science has led me to use MySQL for a project focused on performing 
            diverse data analysis tasks on voters' information.
          </p>

          <p>
          Growing up in five different countries, including South Korea, the United States, Malaysia, Thailand, and Taiwan, has cultivated my adaptability and 
          open-mindedness. These qualities have proven invaluable throughout my career as a software engineer, where I continually seek to learn new tools and 
          technologies to tackle complex challenges. Outside of work, I enjoy engaging in social activities and pursuing an active lifestyle. 
          My interests encompass soccer, golf, boxing, hiking, and maintaining a regular fitness regimen.
